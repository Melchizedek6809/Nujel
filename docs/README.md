# The Nujel Programming Language

## Stable
These documents describe parts of the language that are very unlikely to change except for details.
- [Nujel Introduction](./stable/1.0-introduction.md)
- [Variables](./stable/1.1-variables.md)
- [Arithmetic](./stable/1.2-arithmetic.md)

## Unstable
These parts will probably still change quite a bit, but probably not in major ways.
- [Module system](./unstable/modules.md)

## Experimental
If there is not documentation available for a feature/system then it might change drastically in future versions, so please keep that in mind when writing code using ondocumented features.
