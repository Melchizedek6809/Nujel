Why not X?
------------------------------------------

This is a collection of notes created while evaluation various
runtimes for usage with *WolkenWelten*. Probably not that interesting to
others unless also evaluating various (lisp) runtimes. As you can probably
guess from reading them I put a lot of weight on the **performance** of the runtime
which is mainly due to it being the prime blocker for subsystems being moved
over into the scripting layer. Because of that fast number crunching is of the
utmost importance. Apart from that due to the fact that WASM is a prime target platform
the **size** of the (static!) binary is very important as well.

I will add documents here over time as well as append to old documents as I learn new
things.
