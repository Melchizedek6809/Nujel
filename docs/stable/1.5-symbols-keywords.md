## Symbols / Keywords
Keywords have to start, or end, with a single `:` character and are self-evaluating. They are a distinct type from symbols but can be easily converted.
```scheme
:asd ; A keyword
; => :asd

asd: ; Another keyword
; => asd:

[= asd: :asd] ; It doesn't matter where we put the colon
; => #t

[= :asd [symbol->keyword 'asd]]
; => #t
```
