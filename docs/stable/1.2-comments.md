# Comments
Comments use Scheme syntax, and some SRFI's have been implemented directly.
```scheme
; A single semicolon comments out everything until the next line
(+ 1 #;2 3) ; You can use #; to comment out the following form, should be SRFI-62 compatible!
; => 4
#|
 | Nujel also allows for SRFI-30 like nested Multi-line comments
 |#
[comment [println "A message, never to be printed."]] ; Nujel also has a comment macro, this however returns #nil unlike #;
```

Apart from that it is recommended to use a single `;` at the end of a line to comment whatever is happening on that particular line.

If however you would like to comment a bigger section of code you should put 2 `;;` at the beginning of the line.

For top-level comments describing the entire file try and use 3 `;;;` at the beginning of the lines.

The comment macro is mostly useful for usage with `nujel-mode` since you can easily evaluate commented out forms. Beware however that everything within a comment macro needs to be a valid Nujel S-Expression!

This is in accordance with *Scheme*, *Common Lisp* as well as *Clojure* best practices.
