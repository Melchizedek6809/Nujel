## Parentheses
Nujel uses the S-Expression notation as used by languages such as *Lisp*, *Scheme* and *Clojure*, but with one difference: Nujel defaults to using brackets instead of parentheses. This is mainly because brackets are much easier to type with a default US keyboard layout. You can still use parentheses if you must, since the two are completely interchangeable.
```scheme
[+ 1 2] ; => 3
(+ 1 2) ; => 3
```

Dotted pairs are also supported:
```scheme
[car '[a . b]] ; => a
[cdr '[a . b]] ; => b
[car [cons 1 2]] ; => 1
[cdr [cons 1 2]] ; => 2
```
And as you can see Nujel uses `car` and `cdr` to access the first or rest parts of lists. To build a new pair you can use `cons`.
