# Quote / Quasiquote
Quote works as you would expect, quasiquote however uses the clojure syntax for `unquote`/`unquote-splicing`. This is because I want to be able to treat `,` as white-space (it also looks very similar to a period, which I dislike).
```scheme
'a ; You can quote symbols
; => a

'[1 2 3] ; Or lists
; => [1 2 3]

'(1 2 3) ; With parentheses or brackets
; => [1 2 3]

`[1 2 ~[+ 1 1 1]] ; To unquote you can use a tilde
; => [1 2 3]

`[1 ~@[list 2 3]] ; And ~@ for unquote-splicing
; => [1 2 3]

```
