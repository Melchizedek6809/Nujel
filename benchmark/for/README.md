This directory contains a lot of micro-benchmarks testing how fast
tiny loops doing additions are in various languages.  These should mostly
be idiomatic but can have some minor optimizations as long as these seem reasonable
(no inline assembly or something like that).  Apart from that, these are meant to
roughly gauge the performance of Nujel and hopefully help in determining slow parts
of Nujel.
